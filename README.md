# Crash Stats Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Crash Stats Data Analysis Project! This repository contains the code used to analyse road crash data and ppt slide prepared for VicRoads to enhance road safety and decision-making. The analysis is based on CrashStats data provided by VicRoads.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to gain insights into crash patterns and severity, which can help inform road safety strategies and interventions. The analysis includes various steps, such as data extraction, cleaning, exploration, visualisation and modelling.

## Repository Files
The project is organised as follows:

data/: Please download the dataset from https://vicroadsopendatastorehouse.vicroads.vic.gov.au/opendata/Road_Safety/ACCIDENT.zip.

code/: This file contains Jupyter Notebook file with the code for data analysis, feature selection, modeling, and visualisation.

ppt/: This ppt slide contains images of visualisations and plots generated during the analysis, it's prepared for VicRoads to enhance road safety and decision-making.

README.md: This is the README file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
The project relies on various Python libraries for data analysis, visualisation, and modelling.

## Results and Insights
The analysis of the CrashStats data has yielded valuable insights into crash patterns, severity factors, contributing factors, road types, time trends, and more. These insights can be used to develop targeted risk management strategies, improve road safety measures, and prioritise interventions for high-risk areas.
